# data_science_project_2022
## Background
Despite the fact that most of our planet is covered with water, not more than 3 % of this amount is fresh. To make sure that the water is safe to drink the Estonian Health Board has been measuring its quality in more than thousand water stations across the country thereby making sure that every citizen will get the freshest water right from their tap.
To bring water quality measurement to the next level and automate working process of Estonian water inspectors, we would like to invent predictive water quality model that would enable us to prioritize the tests or react proactively to the deterioration of the water conditions. Therefore, enhancing the role of scientific and data-driven approach on a governmental level.

## Goal
The goal of this competition is to create a model that predicts the water quality in Estonian water stations based on the governmentâ€™s open data of the previous measurements.
